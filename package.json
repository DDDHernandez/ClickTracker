  "description": "The Clicky Tracker Test your memory of Will Ferrell's movies with The Click Tracker Game. The Click Tracker is a memory skill application built using React. The objective of the game is to be able to go through and click each player's image once. Each time you click a film poster, your score goes up by one. If you click a films poster twice, you lose and the game resets (score goes back to 0).",
